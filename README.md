# api-server

Establish an API server which is written in ES2015+.

## What's included?

- [x] Express
- [x] nodemon
- [x] Basic routing
- [x] ES2015 (`async/await` and stage-0 features)
- [ ] Basic unit testing
- [x] Lint with XO

## Download

To download a bare repo, you can run following commands in your shell:

```bash
$ npm i -g download-repo-cli
$ download-repo egoist/api-server -o api-server
$ cd api-server
# let the hacking begin! ðŸŽ‰
```

It's quite like `git clone --depth=1`, but a little faster and do not contain any commit history.
